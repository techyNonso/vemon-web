            What's in this SaaS agreement? The fundamental obligation of the
            provider under the agreement is to make its software accessible to
            the customer via the internet as a service. The customer is granted
            a licence to use that software, subject to a set of restrictions and
            prohibitions that can be tweaked for each individual case. The
            provider may also be obliged to provide support services, and to
            ensure that it complies with certain requirements in relation to the
            maintenance of the software (for example, notice requirements). The
            data supplied by the customer are the property of the customer and,
            insofar as such data are personal data, are subject to a standard
            GDPR-friendly data processing clause. The customer data may be
            specified to be confidential. In consideration for the undertaking
            to provide the services, the customer agrees to pay to the provider
            the relevant charges and to ensure that the customer data will not
            create any liabilities on the part of the service provider. What
            legal documents do I need for my SaaS or cloud service? There are
            five main classNamees of document you should consider: Privacy of
            service; privacy policies; Privacy and conditions of website use;
            end user documents; and intra-customer and intra-user documents.
            First, you need Privacy of service – although they might be called
            something else. They might be called the "user agreement" or the
            "cloud service contract" or something different entirely. This SaaS
            agreement, our SaaS Privacy and conditions and our cloud services
            Privacy and conditions are all examples of Privacy of service
            documents. Whatever the document is called, its function is to
            regulate the legal relationship between a service provider and its
            customers. The Privacy of service will contain provisions covering
            the core services obligation, the payment of charges, the term of
            the contract and its termination, the parties' liability to one
            another, and so on. In some cases, the Privacy of service will be
            supplemented by additional subject-matter specific documents, such
            as data processing agreements and service level agreements. Second,
            you are likely to need a privacy policy. Privacy policies are used
            by organisations acting as data controllers to make disclosures to
            data subjects relating to the handling of personal data. Even if you
            are a processor with respect to much of the personal data in your
            database, you are likely to be a controller in some respects. For
            instance, you would usually be a controller of personal data in your
            customer relationship management system. See our free privacy policy
            for more. Third, if your website is not coterminous with your
            service, you will need Privacy and conditions to cover the use of
            the website. See our free website Privacy and conditions for more.
            Fourth, for many B2B services and for some B2C services, there may
            be users of the service who are not your customers and therefore not
            directly bound by the Privacy of service. In these cases, you may
            want to introduce additional documents which are binding upon both
            customers and non-customer users. Examples of this type of document
            include end user licence agreements and acceptable use policies.
            Fifth, a minority of SaaS and cloud services allow users to create
            contractual relationships with others – for example marketplaces for
            services, physical goods or digital goods. In some cases, it may be
            advantageous to provide standard documentation to govern these
            relationships. The documentation can be provided as mandatory or
            default documentation. In all cases, you should carefully
            circumscribe your liability in relation to the provision of any such
            documentation: you are not acting as your customers' lawyer. Who
            should prepare my SaaS or cloud agreement? The core SEQ Legal
            business is the sale and supply of templates. Nevertheless, we think
            that there are many circumstances where you should use a lawyer
            rather than a template legal document. In one sense a template isn't
            a substitute for a lawyer. Lawyers also work from precedents. By
            opting to use a template, you are taking on the lawyer's role.
            Before using a template, businesses should ask themselves: is the
            use of a lawyer commercially justified? Deciding whether it makes
            commercial sense will involve balancing risks and costs. Ask
            yourself the following questions. What are the risks associated with
            this contract? To what extent would a good lawyer help me to
            mitigate those risks? Do I have access to a lawyer with the right
            experience? Do I have access to appropriate templates? Will a lawyer
            help smooth the contracting process? What legal fees will I have to
            pay? How much time would it take me to prepare the document? Only by
            considering these and other relevant factors will you be able to
            make a sensible assessment. If you do decide to use a template, you
            should keep that decision under review. For example, it might make
            commercial sense to use a template for a new and untested service.
            However, if the service starts making significant amounts of money,
            you should engage a lawyer to review, advise on and update the
            document. How should I go about choosing a template document? Once
            you have decided to use a template for your cloud service or SaaS
            contract, you need to decide which template. There are three main
            aspects to suitability: execution style, structure and content.
            Execution style: will your document be agreed online or offline or
            both? How, specifically, will it be executed or agreed? Our SaaS
            agreement documents (including this free template) assume offline
            agreement, whereas our SaaS Privacy and conditions documents are
            agnostic, allowing for both online and offline agreement via a
            services order form. Our cloud services Privacy and conditions
            assume there will be an online sign-up process. Structure: will your
            document create a single contract with each customer, or could there
            be multiple contracts? In the case of a single contract, are
            different elements of the services independently terminable?
            Content: what is actually covered by your document? The types of
            clauses you might find in a long-form SaaS contract are listed
            below. Ensure that the template you choose covers all or most of the
            necessary subjects. Definitions of special Privacy Contract term and
            termination Set up / configuration services Development services
            Hosted / cloud services Support and maintenance Service levels

            jurisdiction Alternative dispute resolution How is liabillity
            limited in SaaS / cloud Privacy of service? The essence of cloud
            services is efficiency through standardisation: all customers using
            a single instance of an application, with uniform support and
            maintenance arrangements. This standardisation is reflected in the
            contractual sphere by the use of non-negotiable Privacy of service.
            Where Privacy of service are non-negotiable, they will usually say a
            good deal about the protection of the interests of the services
            provider, and relatively little about the protection of the
            interests of customers. However, if you run a small services
            provider selling to enterprise customers, you will know that even if
            an enterprise customer's procurement team are interested in
            purchasing a standard product, their legal team may be unwilling to
            accept standard legal documents. They will give particular attention
            to the provisions of your Privacy and conditions dealing with
            liability. In this category – liability provisions – I would include
            the following. Warranties, which assert that particular facts are
            true, and if proven false may ground a claim for damages. For
            example, a services provider may warrant that its software does not
            infringe any person's intellectual property rights. Limits of
            liability, which seek to reduce the amount of a claim in the event
            of a breach of warranty or another breach of contract. These may
            restrict recovery of particular types of loss (for instance,
            reputational damage) or losses arising from a particular cause (for
            instance, losses caused by third party services providers). In
            addition, they may apply one or more caps to the amounts which may
            be claimed. Commonly, such caps are set by reference to charges
            under the contract and/or available insurance coverage. Indemnities,
            which seek to extend the indemnifier's liability beyond that arising
            out of a breach of contract. For example, a services provider may be
            asked to indemnify the customer in relation to any allegations and
            claims that software infringes intellectual property rights, whether
            or not it does in fact infringe. The indemnifier will often seek
            control of any claims as a quid pro quo for this type of indemnity.
            What alternative SaaS-related legal documents are available? We
            publish a range of SaaS and hosted services contracts. Each document
            is available in two forms: as a downloadable MS Word template on
            Website Contracts, and as an online document in Docular. Using
            Docular, you edit the document online, and after editing download to
            your computer. You can download at any time in a variety of formats.
